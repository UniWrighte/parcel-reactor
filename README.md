# parcel-reactor
parcel-react bootstrapper

Easy way to get a React project off the ground using parcel. Gives nearly the same functionality as create-react-app.


run:

    npm i -g parcel-reactor

now go to the directory where you want to initilize your repository and run:

    parcel-reactor hello-world

    cd hello-world
    
    npm i
    
You may need to install parcel, follow the instructions here if you haven't installed parcel yet:

  https://parceljs.org/getting_started.html
  
This was tested on Linux (Ubuntu 18.04) after running:

    npm install -g parcel-bundler
    
Your results may very on other operating systems or with non-global installs of parcel. 

Enjoy!
